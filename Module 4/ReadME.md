# Module 4 Notes

## Week 11- March 28

-	Colonialism in digital work 
-	The consequences of what we are doing in module 4 
-	MAYBE THERE ISNT ANYY??

-	Does what we have done reveal unintended assumptions 

-	There is a real opportunity for damage when you bring something into the physical world 

### Context is important

Purpose and reason is important to explore and question 


Physically producing a copy of a copy would be redundant and further displacing it from its context 

**Ethics and societal implications

What danger puts you in by messing with an icon? “Who does this hurt?” – if you’re not questioning the implications and who this hurts then that’s the real fail 

### Convolutional Neuro Network 
-	The more you are exposed to a certain stimulus, neurons fir off in similar patterns 
-	What you see is a pattern of connections
-	If this is true you can program a computer with series of computational neurons to recognize an image 

o	Layers in the middle – string on numbers that represent the thing

o	If you provide sound, you can scape a visual soundscape

### Imaginary Soundscape
-	Produces sound based on a series of probabilities based on the image
-	Gets sample sound from labeled sound files 

Imaginary soundscape 2  qos (without 2 is the map)
Reflect on the ways that the AI is seeing the world

Tie physical things to digital data 
May want to design a physical experience with this system
