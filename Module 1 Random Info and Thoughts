### Object info 
- why you selected the object nad why we should care 

### Paradata 
- what we read, what we are trying to accomplish and why it matters 
- think about where it sits on the graph thing 
- could inculde in paradata?

Began as a design by (designers name?) and was used as packaging on a box for a houshold item. the design had purposflu meaninng behind it. 
The product itself had a long history in the homes of Americans.
Warhol took the design and produced it onto a more permanent form (wooden box).
Then #### I made a 3D model of teh sculture.
each step has its own narrative and goal. same artifact but different meaning. 

Brillo Boxes is a fac simile of a fac similie
Legality of copying commercial artwork? where are the ethicall boundries? Because it is art does that make it Ok?
what constitues what are is? who gets to decide??
the removal of the artist from teh actual handy work - is it still creative? does concept still = art?

obscuring historical value of teh Brillo box and company and instead making it a peice of art used to comment on commercialism
the "art" and Warhol's intention obsucures teh brillance of teh actual design which is not his.
Colours are that of teh american flag and represent american culture to Warhol. 
 
### Process notes
- our own notes along the way 
- descibe intents, glitchs, things breaking, things NOT WORKING OUT 
- think about authenticity, aura, trust of the thing you are making and ANYTHING that gets digitaized 
(what we vaue is the fact that the authentic object WITNESSED history and the recreation is only a visual representation 
- dedication in photomasking makes you see and understand the image/object more (the same way an artist understands its subject) 
- personal incounter/initmate relationship with the subject
