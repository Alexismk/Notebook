# MODULE 2: Thoughts and Idea


### Notion of authenticity, and ownership
- And Warhol's work was often ripped off of other graphic artists or photographerâ€™s.
- Some debate if his work should be considered art or authentic because he often didn't even have a direct hand in making them. 


## Remix Possibilities:

### Twitter bot
 - tweets out quotes or written works by Andy Warhol
 - mixes the words of his quotes/etc into randomized tweets
 - he DID say he wanted to be a machine, right? 
 
 
 ### A model of a sort?
 - Some model or visual representation that overlays his work with the authentic piece that he was copying
