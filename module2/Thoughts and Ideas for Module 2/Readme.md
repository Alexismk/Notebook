# MODULE 2: Thoughts and Idea


### Notion of authenticity, and ownership
- Andy Warhol's work was often ripped off of other graphic artists or photographer’s.
- Some debate if his work should be considered art or authentic because he often didn't even have a direct hand in making them. 


## Remix Possibilities:

### Twitter bot
 - tweets out quotes or written works by Andy Warhol
 - mixes the words of his quotes/etc into randomized tweets
 - he DID say he wanted to be a machine, right? 
 
 
 ### A model of a sort?
 - Some model or visual representation that overlays his work with the authentic piece that he was copying
 
 
 # THINGS TO INCLUDE FOR MODULE 2

- Log process note and STEPS 
- Make an effort to tie what you are doing to your annotations, to discussions, to things Shawn has said 
- Each annotation has its own unique URL so you can link your thoughts and process to your annotation
- Use what you were hearing and work it into your process notes 
- What is critical to YOU is to reflect on what you are doing – HOW is this meaningful and WHY  

++ADD what my camera was, what the error messages were

Para data has to meaningful, not necessarily long


If it didn’t work out the first time, acknowledge that and you can uses somebody else’s work. Thin about the re-use processes and what that means. 


AS LONG AS YOU TRANSFORMING THE INITIAL MODEL 


Twitter bot may be better for the 3rd module – giving your model and underlying experience
