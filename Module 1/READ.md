# Module 1: Random Info and Thoughts


## Object info 
- why you selected the object nad why we should care 


## Paradata 
- What we read, what we are trying to accomplish and why it matters 
- think about where it sits on the graph thing 
- could include in paradata?

Began as a design by (designer’s name?) and was used as packaging on a box for a household item. The design had purposeful meaning behind it. 
The product itself had a long history in the homes of Americans.
Warhol took the design and produced it onto a more permanent form (wooden box).
Then I made a 3D model of the sculpture.
Each step has its own narrative and goal. Same artifact but different meaning. 

Brillo Boxes is a fac simile of a fac similie
Legality of copying commercial artwork? Where are the ethical boundaries? Because it is art does that make it Ok?
What constitutes what are is? Who gets to decide??
The removal of the artist from the actual handy work - is it still creative? Does concept still = art?

Obscuring historical value of the Brillo box and company and instead making it a peice of art used to comment on commercialism
The "art" and Warhol's intention obscures the brilliance of the actual design which is not his.
Colours are that of the American flag and represent American culture to Warhol. 
 
## Process notes
- Our own notes along the way 
- describe intents, glitch’s, things breaking, things NOT WORKING OUT 
- think about authenticity, aura, trust of the thing you are making and ANYTHING that gets digitized 
(What we value is the fact that the authentic object WITNESSED history and the recreation is only a visual representation 
- Dedication in photo masking makes you see and understand the image/object more (the same way an artist understands its subject) 
- Personal encounter/intimate relationship with the subject
