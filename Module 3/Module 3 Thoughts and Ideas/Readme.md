# Module 3: Thoughts and Ideas


**Interactivity!!
"How does interacting with the artefact in the context of a digital world change what it is to know this artefact?"



Is all about the IMMERSIVE experience
o	Twitter bot â€“ things talk back to you 


#### Andy Warhol Quote generator twitter bot
mechanized yet speaks to you - like his art 
* he always wanted to be a machine
it is the meaning that you derive form it is the most important 


INTERACTIVE because he will talk to you - twitter replies


Hello - Hello, Why are you trying to talk to a machine?

Who are you? - I am whoever or whatever you want me to be, I am the mechnized voice of Andy Warhol, I am what I have always wanted to be 

Hey Andy, can I have my very own quote? - Link to quotes (how tho??)




Chose a quote of his written in plain text as the banner. 
wrote it in GitHub and screen shotted it  to make an image


Chose a free for use photo i found online. I chose one that was not just a simple photograph of him, but an image that was manipulated and edited in a way that reflected his own style of work. in this way he looks less liek a human, and more like his own work and a machine creation.


contemplation of his tweets function like his obscure art work.
