# Feb 26 - Module 3: The Virtual World of the Past


•	Module 3 is about the IMMERSIVE experience
- Twitter bot – things talk back to you 
- Twine is very easy to use 


•	Humans have always been building virtual world even before computers
- The caves of Lascaux, Stonehenge, and Disney world are all virtual worlds
- Humans tell stories and they weave these stories into landscapes
          	- Tied with how we explain things how we make sense of the world and how we explain these things to others


#### Chris Crawford
“Games are the most ancient and time honoured vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one, having received the seal of approval of natural selection.”
- Games and play are a formative way for humans to understand the world
- Playful engagement in safe ways helps us understand the limits of society 
- Early literature encourages the ability that games have for educations


#### Games are models for external situations, but the interaction has to be meaningful 
-	Has to be some conflict of challenge to overcome
-	The games space is safe and allows you to carry out the game – you won’t actually get hurt 
-	*videogames can only be ethical if there are real consequences
-	Instant death
-	The choices in the game HAVE to matter 


#### MDA Model – Three dimensions to measure a game
-	Mechanic: basic rules and codes
- Dynamics
-	Aesthetics: emotional response evoked

Historians care about video game simulations because it allows us to move away from questions if “what happened” to “why it happened”
Contingency is the hardest to teach and understand. The way things happened is hard. 

**The immersive experience changes how you engage with the material 

Why do we play games?
-	“What will happen next??” – historians what to know what will/could happen next 

Same motivations for historians:
-	What happened
-	Why did it happened 

Simulations -Romans Must Die:

Simulations are games that play themselves. In a game the player is an active agent. In simulations, we can text out consequences. If our stories are true – the same outcome will happen. If the story is wrong the outcomes will be different. 
Variable factors are flowing simultaneously.
Simulation is NOT an oracle 

#### Procedural Literacy/ Procedural Rhetoric’s
-	Representing argument through experience 
-	Argues that the mechanics or the game are far more important than the graphics
-	Text game can trump graphical games 
-	Arguments about the word are encoded in their sets of codes and rules 
-	The ways that the mechanics and algorithms allow certain experiences to be reinforced is what we need to interrogate and acknowledge 

-	Ludology: the study of games and the study of games as a unique field distinctive from narrative
-	Ludus: rule based games
-	Paideia: free form games
-	Narratology: narrative based 

More useful: a typology of time and space
The way games treat space and tie helps you compare games and see what they do to history and how we understand it 

#### Alternate Reality Games
-	Take place is physical space 
-	Simulation if the physical world 
-	Ai 
-	Treasure hunt/ story 


Ergodic texts
-	Built on a series of different trends – choose your own adventure books, video games 
-	Greek for “struggle and path”
-	You have to do work to understand. The meaning comes through in the performance 
- Elaborate backstory and consuming narrative 
- Series of transmedia puzzles and challenges to move the story forwards
-	Finding physical artefacts that move the story forward
-	Often rely on ideas of hidden knowledge and secret societies 


-	Is it right to mess with history this way?
-	Fake Wiki page escaped the confines of the game

#### ARGS for History 
Valuable to historians because
-	They are immersive, authentic experience  
- need to think like a n historian to succeed
-	Allows for multiple perspectives and views
-	Meaning making 

AR could be useful for public history 
Fielddaylab.org can help you make and ARG 




# Mar 05 - History in Videogames

#### Kingdom Come: Deliverance

- The othering that takes place – mercenary armies that are considered savage
- Decidedness what IS and isn’t important to the historical past 
- Decisions in what stays and is left out matters- this game touts realism 
- Impossible to show the entire scope of human experience
- The silences says more about this history itself
- This game has to decide what warrants representation 


What does authenticity look like in this game?

- Focuses on 9 square km in Bohemia
- Huge melting top and it was not uncommon to find people of colour 
- Representation isn’t a priority 
- The choice of what gets represented and what is omitted speaks to current events
o	Heroes – bohemians
o	Villains – the “other”, different, gay characters
- Argument that is fully in line with modern ideas in the Czech republic 
- Choosing to represent elements of Czech history in a certain way that reflects current arguments 


#### Questions when playing a historical game
- Who is the villain?
- Who is the hero?
- Who matters in the story?
- Who is left out?
Interrogate silences. Decisions about who matters reflects political views. 


#### Questions of mechanics:
- Are the actions reasonable in the context of this era?
- Are these actions meaningful within the context of the game (do they carry consequences)
- Games set in the past may have VERY different mechanics
- Sims vs shooters 
- WHAT YOURE ALLOWED TO DO MATTERS

THE GRAPHICS DON’T MATTER ONE BIT if it doesn’t effect that story line 
Memory is part of our experience. Being hung up on graphics separates us from the history
